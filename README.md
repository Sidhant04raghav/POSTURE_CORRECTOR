# POSTURE_CORRECTOR
My major purpose was to create a cheap and efficient posture corrector .Most of the projects that were available in the  market were extremely expensive and required extremely complex technology. This posture corrector can be supremely beneficial in the corporate world and the making cost is merely 3 dollars. It has been made using arduino and hc-sr04 (ultrasonic sensor)
